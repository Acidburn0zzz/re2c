<h1>re2c</h1>

<h2>2004-05-25: 0.9.3 released</h2>
<h2>2003-12-09: Current Project</h2>
re2c is a great tool and has been unmaintained for quite some time, and
in fact doesn't even compile with recent versions of gcc.&nbsp; I've
used re2c in a few of my projects (e.g. OpenWBEM), and I have an
interest in lexers (I wrote a dynamic lexer called slex as an example
for the Spirit parser framework (see http://spirit.sf.net/)).&nbsp; I
didn't want to see it suffer bit-rot as there are a few bugs which need
to be fixed as well as some new features that would be nice to
add.&nbsp; So, after trying to contact either Peter Bumbulis or Brian
Young, I decided to adopt the project and use SourceForge.net to host
it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I very much welcome anyone who would like to contribute to the project,
either as a developer with CVS access or by simply sending patches, bug
reports, or suggestions for improvement.&nbsp; I have created a mailing
list: re2c-general at lists dot sourceforge dot net which should be
used for all communication about re2c.<br>
<br>
Please use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/re2c">SourceForge
facilities</a> to download re2c, report bugs, subscribe to the mailing
list, etc.<br>

The re2c distribution can be found at:<br>

The source distribution is available from:<br>

http://www.tildeslash.org/re2c/re2c-0.9.1.tar.gz<br>
<br>
This distribution is a cleaned up version of the 0.5 release<br>
maintained by me (Brian Young). Several bugs were fixed as well<br>
as code cleanup for warning free compilation. It has been developed<br>
and tested with egcs 1.0.2 and gcc 2.7.2.3 on Linux x86. Peter<br>
Bumbulis' original release can be found at:<br>

re2c is a great tool for writing fast and flexible lexers. It has<br>
served many people well for many years and it deserves to be<br>
maintained more actively. re2c is on the order of 2-3 times faster<br>
than a flex based scanner, and its input model is much more<br>
flexible.<br>
<br>
Patches and requests for features will be entertained. Areas of<br>
particular interest to me are porting (a Solaris and an NT<br>
version will be forthcoming) and wide character support. Note<br>
that the code is already quite portable and should be buildable<br>
on any platform with minor makefile changes.<br>

re2c is a tool for generating C-based recognizers from regular<br>
expressions. re2c-based scanners are efficient: for programming<br>
languages, given similar specifications, an re2c-based scanner is<br>
typically almost twice as fast as a flex-based scanner with little or no<br>
increase in size (possibly a decrease on cisc architectures). Indeed,<br>
re2c-based scanners are quite competitive with hand-crafted ones.<br>
<br>
Unlike flex, re2c does not generate complete scanners: the user must<br>
supply some interface code. While this code is not bulky (about 50-100<br>
lines for a flex-like scanner; see the man page and examples in the<br>
distribution) careful coding is required for efficiency (and<br>
correctness). One advantage of this arrangement is that the generated<br>
code is not tied to any particular input model. For example, re2c<br>
generated code can be used to scan data from a null-byte terminated<br>
buffer as illustrated below.<br>
<br>
Given the following source<br>
<br>
#define NULL ((char*) 0)<br>
char *scan(char *p){<br>
char *q;<br>
#define YYCTYPE char<br>
#define YYCURSOR p<br>
#define YYLIMIT p<br>
#define YYMARKER q<br>
#define YYFILL(n)<br>
/*!re2c<br>
[0-9]+ {return YYCURSOR;}<br>
[\000-\377] {return NULL;}<br>
*/<br>
}<br>

if(YYLIMIT == YYCURSOR) YYFILL(1);<br>

if(yych &lt;= '9') goto yy6;<br>
goto yy3;<br>
}<br>
#line 12<br>

<br>
Note that most compilers will perform dead-code elimination to remove<br>
all YYCURSOR, YYLIMIT comparisions.<br>
<br>
re2c was developed for a particular project (constructing a fast REXX<br>
scanner of all things!) and so while it has some rough edges, it should<br>
be quite usable. More information about re2c can be found in the<br>
(admittedly skimpy) man page; the algorithms and heuristics used are<br>
described in an upcoming LOPLAS article (included in the distribution).<br>
Probably the best way to find out more about re2c is to try the supplied<br>
examples. re2c is written in C++, and is currently being developed<br>
under Linux using gcc 2.5.8.<br>
