In order to reproduce benchmark results, one should first generate input data.
Random data can be generated with the following programs (written in haskell):

    http/gen/gen_http.hs
    uri/gen/gen_uri.hs

Use the following scripts to build generators:

    http/gen/mk_gen.sh
    uri/gen/mk_gen.sh

The size of the generated data is hard-coded in the source code of generators
(and can be easily tweaked).

Alternatively, if you don't have haskell compiler or for any other reason are
unable to build generators, use small data samples provided for each benchmark
(one can copy-paste them many times with 'cat' to obtain a large input file):

    http/gen/sample.dat
    uri/gen/sample.dat
