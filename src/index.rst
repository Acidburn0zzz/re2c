*re2c* is a tool for writing very fast and flexible scanners. Unlike
any other such tool, *re2c* focuses on generating high efficient code for 
regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of 
use than any traditional lexer offers. And last but not least *re2c* 
generates warning free code that is equal to hand-written code in terms of 
size, speed and quality.

The above made the `PHP team to use <http://php.net>`_ *re2c* in various places.
