``-W``
    Turn on all warnings.

``-Werror``
    Turn warnings into errors. Note that this option along
    doesn't turn on any warnings, it only affects those warnings that have
    been turned on so far or will be turned on later.

``-W<warning>``
    Turn on individual ``warning``.

``-Wno-<warning>``
    Turn off individual ``warning``.

``-Werror-<warning>``
    Turn on individual ``warning`` and treat it as error (this implies ``-W<warning>``).

``-Wno-error-<warning>``
    Don't treat this particular ``warning`` as error. This doesn't turn off
    the warning itself.
