- root position always has nonzero explicit submatch index

- double explicit submatch group that maps to the same implicit submatch group: ((...)) is collapsed in mark() and enum ()

- This is what I had to do in GOR correcness proof anyway --- first get rid of epsilon-loops (aka "problematic" paths),
  then prove right distributivity of comparison over concatenation for the rest. In the presence of epsilon-loops
  right distributivity doesn't hold --- I can give an example when a < b, but ac > bc (but then neither ac, nor bc
  correspond to the minimal path, so wrong comparison results for a and b does not cause any trouble). (We shall
  say it in the paper and mention the example, I think.

- The definition of lastht() and first() mentions the case in which the argument begins with a letter.
  However, they seems to be applied only to frames (that do not contain letters). Are there cases in
  which they are applied to something other than frames?

- P.S. I am still a bit uncertain about the usefulness of the subdivision in frames of PEs. Its usefulness is
  obvious in the case of Okui's PAT because them have sequences of parentheses on the arcs, corresponding
  to frames (and have no closure to be done). But in our case we have GOR1 that compares fragments
  of PEs that are not frames, and still uses a notion of rho that is somehow different.
  So, my question is how will we make use of frames in our context?

- I was thinking how to demonstrate Theorem 1. This is an attempt to do it.
  Taken two distinct trees s and t, since the norms are defined over Pos(s) union Pos(t),
  then it is either s < t or t < s (i.e. the ordering is total). Suppose WLOG it is s < t. Then, there is a position p
  for which ||s||_p > ||t||_p and all preceding positions have equal norms. Clearly, it cannot also be t < s.

- here are some examples to show why we define the norm as we do in Definition 4, and the rho and
  subsetting as we do in Definitions 7-10.
     (a|ε)* string a
           s: T^1(T^2(a^0))
           t: T^1(T^2(a^0,ε^0))
           s < t  because the norm for position 1.2 is infinite since it is missing
           it shows subsetting: the first tree has one branch less
     (a|aa)* string aa
           s: T^1(T^2(T^3(a^0,a^0)))
           t: T^1(T^2(T^3(a^0),T^4(a^ 0)))
           s < t because the norm at position 1 is 2 > that of the other, which is 1
           it shows the first tree has the branch for the second a further away from the
           root than the second (bigger rho)
     a|a   string a
           s: T^1(a^0,Φ^0)
           t: T^1(Φ^0,a^0)
           s < t because the norm at position 1 is > of the other which is -1 (missing alternative)
           it shows subsetting: the second tree has one null branch where the first has a
           non-null one
