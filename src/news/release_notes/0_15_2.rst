Release 0.15.2

This release fixes a bug in build system (`reported <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566620>`_ on Gentoo bugtracker).
Fix adds missing dependency (lexer depends on bison-generated header).
It seems that the dependency has always been missing, build order just happened to be correct.
