==============
Release 0.15.1
==============

.. include:: ../home.rst


This release fixes an error in the testing script:
it used locale-sensitive ``sort`` utility,
which resulted in different order of files on different platforms.

Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich who reported the bug and suggested a quick fix. ``:)``
