Braille patterns (encodings)
----------------------------

This example is about encoding support in re2c.
It's a partial decoder from Grade-1 (uncontracted) Unicode English Braille to plain English.
The input may be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 or UCS-2:
all of these encodings are capable of representing Braille patterns (code points ``[0x2800 - 0x28ff]``).
We use ``-r`` option to reuse the same block of re2c rules with different encodings.

So. The hardest part is to get some input.
Here is a message out of the void:

.. include:: examples/06_braille.utf8.txt

It appears to be UTF-8 encoded `[06_braille.utf8.txt] <examples/06_braille.utf8.txt.html>`_.
Convert it into UTF-16, UTF-32 or UCS-2:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ iconv -f utf8 -t utf16le 06_braille.utf8.txt > 06_braille.utf16.txt
    $ iconv -f utf8 -t utf32le 06_braille.utf8.txt > 06_braille.utf32.txt
    $ iconv -f utf8 -t ucs2 06_braille.utf8.txt > 06_braille.ucs2.txt

And the input is ready.

Grade-1 Braille is quite simple (compared to Grade-2 Braille).
Patterns map directly to symbols (letters, digits and punctuators) except for a couple of special patterns:
numeric mode indicator (⠼), letter mode indicator (⠰), capital letter (⠠)
and some other, which we omit for simplicity (as well as a few ambiguous punctuation patterns).
Grade-2 Braille allows contractions; they obey complex rules (like those of a natural language)
and are much harder to implement.

`[06_braille.re] <examples/06_braille.re>`_

.. include:: examples/06_braille.re
    :code: cpp
    :number-lines:

Notes:

* Reuse mode is enabled with ``-r`` option.
* In reuse mode re2c expects a single ``/*!rules:re2c ... */`` block
  followed by multiple ``/*!use:re2c ... */`` blocks.
  All blocks can have their own configurations, definitions and rules.
* Encoding can be enabled either with command-line option or with configuration.
* Each encoding needs an appropriate code unit type (``YYCTYPE``).
* We use conditions to switch between numeric and normal modes.

Generate, compile and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ re2c -cr8 -o example.cc 06_braille.re
    $ g++ -o example example.cc
    $ ./example
