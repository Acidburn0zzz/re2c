re2c was originally written by Peter Bumbulis (peter@csg.uwaterloo.ca)
and described in research article
`"RE2C: a more versatile scanner generator" <../1994_bumbulis_cowan_re2c_a_more_versatile_scanner_generator.pdf>`_
by Peter Bumbulis, Donald D. Cowan, 1994,
ACM Letters on Programming Languages and Systems (LOPLAS).
Since then re2c has been maintained and developed by multiple volunteers,
most notably,
Brian Young (bayoung@acm.org),
Markus Boerger (helly@users.sourceforge.net),
Dan Nuffer (nuffer@users.sourceforge.net)
and Ulya Trofimovich (skvadrik@gmail.com).
Recent development of re2c is described in research article
`"Tagged Deterministic Finite Automata with Lookahead" <../2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finite_automata_with_lookahead.pdf>`_
by Ulya Trofimovich, 2017.
Below is the list of re2c contributors:
many are mentioned by their nicknames and some may be missing.
