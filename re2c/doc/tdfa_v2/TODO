- synthesize rathar than inherit
- examples for how mark + enum work
- more examples
- root position always has nonzero explicit submatch index
- double explicit submatch group that maps to the same implicit submatch group: ((...)) is collapsed in mark() and enum ()
- example of tracing mark() and enum()
- This is what I had to do in GOR correcness proof anyway --- first get rid of epsilon-loops (aka "problematic" paths), then prove right distributivity of comparison over concatenation for the rest. In the presence of epsilon-loops right distributivity doesn't hold --- I can give an example when a < b, but ac > bc (but then neither ac, nor bc correspond to the minimal path, so wrong comparison results for a and b does not cause any trouble). (We shall say it in the paper and mention the example, I think.
- A:
    The paragraph after theorem 1 states that we obtain the Okui ordering by replacing sub with pos.
    I am thinking of it because Okui ranks missing positions in a tree with a norm that is -1, while we rank it infinite.
  Me:
    Rephrase that paragrapgh to say that the minimal tree for fully-tagged trees is included
    in the class of minimal trees for partially-tagged trees.
