- synthesize rathar than inherit
- examples for how mark + enum work
- more examples
- root position always has nonzero explicit submatch index
- double explicit submatch group that maps to the same implicit submatch group: ((...)) is collapsed in mark() and enum ()
- example of tracing mark() and enum()
- This is what I had to do in GOR correcness proof anyway --- first get rid of epsilon-loops (aka "problematic" paths), then prove right distributivity of comparison over concatenation for the rest. In the presence of epsilon-loops right distributivity doesn't hold --- I can give an example when a < b, but ac > bc (but then neither ac, nor bc correspond to the minimal path, so wrong comparison results for a and b does not cause any trouble). (We shall say it in the paper and mention the example, I think.
- A:
    The paragraph after theorem 1 states that we obtain the Okui ordering by replacing sub with pos.
    I am thinking of it because Okui ranks missing positions in a tree with a norm that is -1, while we rank it infinite.
  Me:
    Rephrase that paragrapgh to say that the minimal tree for fully-tagged trees is included
    in the class of minimal trees for partially-tagged trees.

..well, strictly speaking, norms are defined everywhere: that's one of the differences with Okui definition of the norm, and it comes in really handy in the proof of theorem 2 (the one that states that partial order on IRE is a strict weak order): without that extension of the norm to the infinite set of possible positions, the proofs get twice as long (because we have to track domains everywhere and prove obvious things that follow from fact that ||s||_p = ||t||_p if p is not in Pos(s) and not in Pos(t)).

..agreed..

..this is, I think, not needed: we just need to say, "without loss of generality, suppose that s < t".
I will put that in the paper.



OKUI SLIDES!!!
