<h1 class="title">How it works</h1>

<p>Every path in the generated DFA must contain at least one accepting state,
otherwise it causes undefined behaviour and should be reported.
re2c walks DFA in deep-first search and checks all paths.
Each branch of search aborts as soon as it meets accepting state.
Most of the real-world programs only forget to handle a few cases,
so almost all branches abort soon and search takes very little time even for a large DFA.
In pathological cases re2c avoids exponential time and space
consumption by placing an upper bound on the number of faulty patterns.
The shortest patterns are reported first.</p>
<p>Note that the analyses is done anyway.
The option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Wundefined-control-flow</span></tt> only controls if the warning is reported or not.</p>
