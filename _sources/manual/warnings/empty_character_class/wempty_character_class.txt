[-Wempty-character-class]
--------------------------

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

This warning is complementary to ``--empty-class`` option.
The option expects a single argument, one of the following:

* ``match-empty`` (default): empty character class matches empty string
  (that is, always matches and consumes no code units).
  This attitude is strange; however, some real-world programs rely on it.

* ``match-none``: empty character class never matches.
  This is what logic suggests.

* ``error``: empty character class is an error.

The ``[-Wempty-character-class]`` warning is a reminder for those
who are not aware of ``--empty-class`` option.

Note that empty character class can be constructed in many ways:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    /*!re2c
        []                        { return 0; }
        [^\x00-\xFF]              { return 1; }
        [^] \ [^]                 { return 2; }
        [abc] \ ("a" | "b" | "c") { return 3; }
        "a" \ [a-z]               { return 4; }
    */

Given this code, ```re2c -i -Wempty-character-class``` generates:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    /* Generated by re2c 0.14.1.dev on Wed Nov 11 11:42:00 2015*/
    
    {
            YYCTYPE yych;
            { return 0; }
    }

And warns:

.. code-block:: none
