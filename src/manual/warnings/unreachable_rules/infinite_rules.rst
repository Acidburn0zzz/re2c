Infinite rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A rule may be unreachable all by itself, without being shadowed by other rules:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :number-lines:

    /*!re2c
        [^]* { return "greeedy"; }
    */

This rule is so greedy that it never stops.
It will continue eating input until ``YYFILL`` finally fails (```re2c -i -Wunreachable-rules```):

.. code-block:: cpp
    :number-lines:

    /* Generated by re2c 0.14.1.dev on Fri Nov  6 21:36:56 2015*/
    
    {
            YYCTYPE yych;
            goto yy0;
    yy1:
            ++YYCURSOR;
    yy0:
            if (YYLIMIT <= YYCURSOR) YYFILL(1);
            yych = *YYCURSOR;
            goto yy1;
            { return "greeedy"; }
    }

And if we suppress ``YYFILL`` generation with ``re2c:yyfill:enable = 0;``,
lexer will loop until segfault or another disaster forces its untimely shutdown
(unless you use ``--input-api custom`` and do some magic to stop it).
And re2c warns us:

.. code-block::

    re2c: warning: line 2: unreachable rule  [-Wunreachable-rules]

All rules that include ``[^]*`` (or any component isomorphic to ``[^]*``) are also infinite.
